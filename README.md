# SwiftLinearAlgebra
Some playground exercises dealing with Linear Algebra operations from the Udacity refresher course: Linear Algebra Refresher.

Instead of doing this in Python I decided to continue building on my Swift skills.

The playground currently includes exciting linear algebratic operations such as:
 - Finding the magnitude and direction (i.e. Normalization) of vectors
 - Finding the dot product and angles between vectors (Theta)
 - Checking to see if two vectors are parallel
 - Finding the projection vector of a a vector and its base vector.
 - Checking and finding orthogonal vectors
 - Finding the cross product of two vectors
 - Finding the area of a parallelogram and triangle between two vectors
 
 Exercises are also included at the bottom of the playground.
 
 Pull requests welcome!
